# CEX-Methodology
Methodology and data points to gauge developer interest in a cryptocurrency

They always leave out Bitshares. Added Steem.
Coindesk aims to create a tool that can measure interest and activity in cryptocurrencies. This is done by measuring the forces that shape the growth of decentralized networks (ie. we seek to measure cryptoeconomics). Perhaps the most important force to create a succesful decentralized cryptocurrency is one that captures the interest of developers who then contribute to the project. Because this is so vital, yet so complex, the goal for this repo is to organize insight from the developer community to help harden our methodology.
